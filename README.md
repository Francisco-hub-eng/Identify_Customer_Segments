# Identify Customer Segments

Find segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company. 

## Results:

Segments with more purchase power and employment rate form part of the core customer base for a mail-order sales company.

## Strategy:

Use a 85-feature rich demographic dataset of the general population to create a unsupervised learning model to identify segments and cluster in the population. Apply that model to a demographic dataset of customers and find cluster under and overrepresented in the customer dataset compared to the general population dataset.
